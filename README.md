# Finance Positions Reconciliation – SQL Analysis

## Business Problem
Financial operations teams must ensure that positions recorded in front-office systems match records in back-office systems. Differences may lead to financial risk and operational issues.

## Dataset
Simulated front-office and back-office datasets representing positions and cash balances.

## Tools Used
- SQL (CTEs, joins, conditional logic)
- CSV files as data source
- GitHub for version control

## Analysis
The reconciliation process compares quantities between systems and identifies mismatches and missing records.

## Key Insights
- Quantity mismatches indicate potential booking or settlement issues
- Missing records in back-office require immediate investigation

## Business Recommendations
- Implement automated reconciliation checks
- Monitor breaks daily to reduce operational risk
